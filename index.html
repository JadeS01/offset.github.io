      <p>Lack of awareness in everyday activities can result in contributions to climate change issues such as global
        warming. According to the “Assessment of awareness regarding climate change in an urban community”, 63.3% of the
        urban population surveyed believe lifestyle changes would be the most efficient way to combat climate change. It
        is concluded that awareness campaigns are highly recommended. This problem is inherently important because there
        is only one Earth along with its limited resources. As noted by the United Nations Trust Fund for Human
        Security, the degradation of the environment further limits these resources which can worsen social tensions due
        to the increased competition. We designed a platform that connects people to help their communities become more
        mindful of the environment.

      <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid lightgreen" class="w3-round">
      <p><i class="bi bi-diamond-fill" style="font-size: 1rem;"></i> We decided to create an online questionnaire
        because we and many of the peers we planned to survey spent the semester remotely so it was the most logical
        method to use for its convenience. We wanted to know the general level of awareness related to the environment
        from our participants, so we added questions with mood scales. We knew common activities that contribute to
        climate change so we also asked participants to select ones they frequently engaged in. We understand that many
        of these are hard to cease, so we also wanted to ask for written answers on what participants believe could help
        solve the greater issue.</p>
      <p><i class="bi bi-diamond-fill" style="font-size: 1rem;"></i> While we were still iterating over the
        questionnaire, we asked friends if they would be willing to participate in an upcoming survey. We then reached
        out to those friends/peers with the survey link mostly through online platforms such as Discord. 12 users
        participated in the research asynchronously with 50% being S.F. residents and all of them being college-aged
        majoring in disciplines ranging from the humanities to STEM. 58.3% responded with a 4 when asked for their
        familiarity with issues surrounding climate change on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being “not at all” and 5 being
        “very familiar”. That same percentage applied to the same number when asked about their concern regarding global
        warming. 100% of the individuals believed that climate change can be fought against.</p>
      <p><i class="bi bi-diamond-fill" style="font-size: 1rem;"></i> The platform we used for our questionnaire was
        Google Forms, which provides participant statistics for each question which was a great aid in our data
        analysis. We analyzed the data through affinity diagramming on Miro.com. First, we put every response in groups
        of each question on their own note to prepare for grouping ones that shared similar themes. We then grouped the
        questions that either dealt with how the problem pertains to the participants and how they feel about solutions
        for the problem. Within the latter, we put sticky notes related to actions received by users that can be taken
        against the issue to be further analyzed.</p>
      <p><i class="bi bi-diamond-fill" style="font-size: 1rem;"></i> The main findings of the data analysis were that
        most people are very aware of global warming effects and could generally describe long-term climate effects more
        often than a particular instance that affected them personally. The majority of participants are reliant on gas
        and electricity but believe in moving towards renewable energy. This ties to another finding that although many
        engage in activities that emit carbon emissions, they are in favor of limiting these and opting for
        environmentally friendlier substitutes. Another finding is that creating more awareness through education is
        favorable.</p>
      <p><i class="bi bi-diamond-fill" style="font-size: 1rem;"></i>
        In depth analysis:
      <p style="margin-left: 10%;"><i class="bi bi-diamond"></i> Most participants have felt the effects of climate
        change as 6 have noticed seasonal changes that differ from previous years, 5 have felt/noticed increased
        warming, however, 2 were unable to describe any experiences. This was expected as 90.9% of users either
        moderately or extremely care about global warming and 54% are moderately familiar with climate change.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 10%;"><i class="bi bi-diamond"></i> 63.6% of participants leave electronics that aren’t in
        use plugged in however 72.8% either strongly or moderately believe in moving towards renewable energy, 50%
        mildly believe in giving homes an energy retrofit while 16.7% and 33.3% moderately or extremely believe in this,
        and 45.5% strongly believe it’s important to use their home HVAC less. The conclusion drawn from this was that
        although the majority are reliant on gas/electricity, all participants believed in moving towards renewable
        energy despite the varying levels of belief.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 10%;"><i class="bi bi-diamond"></i> 54.5% of participants drink from plastic water bottles,
        45.5% opt for plastic bags, and 36.4% dispose of junk mail. 66.7% strongly believe and 33.3% moderately believe
        in using less plastic and recycling more. 91.7% regularly eat meat but 66.7% had a level of belief in eating
        less meat and consuming more plant-based foods. This may seem strange to gather information on, but according to
        the United Nations, almost a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions around the world originate from agriculture,
        with beef-producing the most emissions.<a
          href="https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-59232599#:~:text=Beef%20produces%20the%20most%20greenhouse,are%2050%25%20less%20than%20beef">
          (https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-59232599#:~:text=Beef%20produces%20the%20most%20greenhouse,are%2050%25%20less%20than%20beef.)</a>
        Changing one’s diet that they may have followed for a lifetime is understandably difficult, so it was expected
        to see a wider range of approval and disagreement.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 10%;"><i class="bi bi-diamond"></i> 72.8% either moderately or mildly believe in limiting
        air travel and 63.5% of participants moderately believe others should consider other options for driving. 27.3%
        frequently air travel or go on road trips. If driving cannot be avoided, 72.8% either strongly or mildly believe
        in opting for hybrid or electric cars.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 10%;"><i class="bi bi-diamond"></i> 4 participants shared that what they believe could help
        fight against climate change is making larger entities such as the government and corporations responsible for
        the change. These ranged from passing more regulations on corporations that produce the majority of the waste to
        donating money to credible organizations that deal with the environment. 2 responses in this grouping added that
        larger entities would bring more positive impact than an individual ever could and that it is unfair to place
        the sole responsibility of reversal and conservation on the consumer. Creating more awareness through education
        was also an interesting response as well as encouraging others to make small changes but expected, as 18.2% of
        participants were not or barely familiar with climate change.</p>
      </p>
      <p><i class="bi bi-diamond-fill" style="font-size: 1rem;"></i> With these findings, we aim to design a product
        that supports the willingness demonstrated by the participants to change or limit the decisions made that impact
        the environment. However, it is understandable that many users are not seeking an entire lifestyle change but
        are rather asking for ways to be educated about the issue. And because some participants felt that expecting
        individuals to take on the role of environmental conservationists burdensome, a type of social platform that
        allows users to log their activities and the carbon footprint created from them and support each other in making
        eco-friendlier choices is what we planned to design.</p>

          <p><i class="bi bi-caret-left-fill"></i>This design focused on collecting the activities logged by the users
            and
            their respective carbon emissions
            emitted. Based on the trends of the activities stored, the user would start seeing suggestions for lifestyle
            changes to offset the emissions. These suggestions would also include resources such as news articles that
            redirect the user from the website to those pages. However, this design does not foster a community-based
            environment and focused excessively on the calculator and logging feature. The tailoring of suggested
            content
            also raised concerns about the amount of user data being given to outside entities.</p>
          <p><i class="bi bi-caret-left-fill"></i>The second design built upon the carbon calculator and activity log
            feature and also added a news feed and threads to meet the goal of creating a social platform. The team

      <p><i class="bi bi-diamond-fill" style="font-size: 1rem; margin-left: 6%;"></i>After selecting a digital
        prototype, we conducted a heuristic evaluation. The main severe issues with the user interface were:</p>
      <p><i class="bi bi-diamond" style="font-size: 1rem; margin-left: 8%;"></i>The UI is too overwhelming for the user
        so separating features into their own page would be helpful. The app also lacks a name.</p>
      <p><i class="bi bi-diamond" style="font-size: 1rem; margin-left: 8%;"></i>It’s not user-intuitive due to the lack of labeling.</p>
      <p><i class="bi bi-diamond" style="font-size: 1rem; margin-left: 8%;"></i>The user should be aware that the information logged is being stored, so there should be a pop-up window asking for approval.</p>
      <p><i class="bi bi-diamond" style="font-size: 1rem; margin-left: 8%;"></i>While there’s a news feed, it doesn’t have much room for users to interact with one another.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 1rem; margin-left: 6.5%;">To summarize this process, the next iteration aimed to resolve the violated Heuristics which 
        involved user control and freedom, linguistic clarity, consistency and standards, and aesthetic 
        integrity.

      <p><i class="bi bi-diamond" style="font-size: 1rem; margin-left: 8%;"></i>We’ve all stated that the interface overloads the user’s visual limits.</p>
      <p><i class="bi bi-diamond" style="font-size: 1rem; margin-left: 8%;"></i>Wilson raised the issue that many buttons do not have a logo and make the overall app lack linguistic clarity.</p>
      <p><i class="bi bi-diamond" style="font-size: 1rem; margin-left: 8%;"></i>Wilson has also raised that there is no app name.</p>
      <p><i class="bi bi-diamond" style="font-size: 1rem; margin-left: 8%;"></i>Jade raised that there is a lack of aesthetic integrity; it’s inappropriate to have a logging design on the same page as a forum design.</p>
      <p><i class="bi bi-diamond" style="font-size: 1rem; margin-left: 8%;"></i>Since the website is collecting user data (self-provided through the activities log), Xinrong stated there’s an issue with not having a history/log page.</p>
      <p><i class="bi bi-diamond" style="font-size: 1rem; margin-left: 8%;"></i>Xinrong also raised that there is a lack of error prevention as the app doesn’t ask for permission to store.</p>
      <p><i class="bi bi-diamond" style="font-size: 1rem; margin-left: 8%;"></i>Ahmad stated that the calculator should have some sort of icon for better predictability.</p>
      <p><i class="bi bi-diamond" style="font-size: 1rem; margin-left: 8%;"></i>The feed interface lacks user control/has too many human limitations.</p>
