      <p>Lack of awareness in everyday activities can result in contributions to climate change issues such as global
        warming. According to the “Assessment of awareness regarding climate change in an urban community”, 63.3% of the
        urban population surveyed believe lifestyle changes would be the most efficient way to combat climate change. It
        is concluded that awareness campaigns are highly recommended. This problem is inherently important because there
        is only one Earth along with its limited resources. As noted by the United Nations Trust Fund for Human
        Security, the degradation of the environment further limits these resources which can worsen social tensions due
        to the increased competition. We designed a platform that connects people to help their communities become more
        mindful of the environment.

      <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid lightgreen" class="w3-round">
      <p><i class="bi bi-diamond-fill" style="font-size: 1rem;"></i> We decided to create an online questionnaire
        because we and many of the peers we planned to survey spent the semester remotely so it was the most logical
        method to use for its convenience. We wanted to know the general level of awareness related to the environment
        from our participants, so we added questions with mood scales. We knew common activities that contribute to
        climate change so we also asked participants to select ones they frequently engaged in. We understand that many
        of these are hard to cease, so we also wanted to ask for written answers on what participants believe could help
        solve the greater issue.</p>
      <p><i class="bi bi-diamond-fill" style="font-size: 1rem;"></i> While we were still iterating over the
        questionnaire, we asked friends if they would be willing to participate in an upcoming survey. We then reached
        out to those friends/peers with the survey link mostly through online platforms such as Discord. 12 users
        participated in the research asynchronously with 50% being S.F. residents and all of them being college-aged
        majoring in disciplines ranging from the humanities to STEM. 58.3% responded with a 4 when asked for their
        familiarity with issues surrounding climate change on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being “not at all” and 5 being
        “very familiar”. That same percentage applied to the same number when asked about their concern regarding global
        warming. 100% of the individuals believed that climate change can be fought against.</p>
      <p><i class="bi bi-diamond-fill" style="font-size: 1rem;"></i> The platform we used for our questionnaire was
        Google Forms, which provides participant statistics for each question which was a great aid in our data
        analysis. We analyzed the data through affinity diagramming on Miro.com. First, we put every response in groups
        of each question on their own note to prepare for grouping ones that shared similar themes. We then grouped the
        questions that either dealt with how the problem pertains to the participants and how they feel about solutions
        for the problem. Within the latter, we put sticky notes related to actions received by users that can be taken
        against the issue to be further analyzed.</p>
      <p><i class="bi bi-diamond-fill" style="font-size: 1rem;"></i> The main findings of the data analysis were that
        most people are very aware of global warming effects and could generally describe long-term climate effects more
        often than a particular instance that affected them personally. The majority of participants are reliant on gas
        and electricity but believe in moving towards renewable energy. This ties to another finding that although many
        engage in activities that emit carbon emissions, they are in favor of limiting these and opting for
        environmentally friendlier substitutes. Another finding is that creating more awareness through education is
        favorable.</p>
      <p><i class="bi bi-diamond-fill" style="font-size: 1rem;"></i>
        In depth analysis:
      <p style="margin-left: 10%;"><i class="bi bi-diamond"></i> Most participants have felt the effects of climate
        change as 6 have noticed seasonal changes that differ from previous years, 5 have felt/noticed increased
        warming, however, 2 were unable to describe any experiences. This was expected as 90.9% of users either
        moderately or extremely care about global warming and 54% are moderately familiar with climate change.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 10%;"><i class="bi bi-diamond"></i> 63.6% of participants leave electronics that aren’t in
        use plugged in however 72.8% either strongly or moderately believe in moving towards renewable energy, 50%
        mildly believe in giving homes an energy retrofit while 16.7% and 33.3% moderately or extremely believe in this,
        and 45.5% strongly believe it’s important to use their home HVAC less. The conclusion drawn from this was that
        although the majority are reliant on gas/electricity, all participants believed in moving towards renewable
        energy despite the varying levels of belief.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 10%;"><i class="bi bi-diamond"></i> 54.5% of participants drink from plastic water bottles,
        45.5% opt for plastic bags, and 36.4% dispose of junk mail. 66.7% strongly believe and 33.3% moderately believe
        in using less plastic and recycling more. 91.7% regularly eat meat but 66.7% had a level of belief in eating
        less meat and consuming more plant-based foods. This may seem strange to gather information on, but according to
        the United Nations, almost a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions around the world originate from agriculture,
        with beef-producing the most emissions.<a
          href="https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-59232599#:~:text=Beef%20produces%20the%20most%20greenhouse,are%2050%25%20less%20than%20beef">
          (https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-59232599#:~:text=Beef%20produces%20the%20most%20greenhouse,are%2050%25%20less%20than%20beef.)</a>
        Changing one’s diet that they may have followed for a lifetime is understandably difficult, so it was expected
        to see a wider range of approval and disagreement.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 10%;"><i class="bi bi-diamond"></i> 72.8% either moderately or mildly believe in limiting
        air travel and 63.5% of participants moderately believe others should consider other options for driving. 27.3%
        frequently air travel or go on road trips. If driving cannot be avoided, 72.8% either strongly or mildly believe
        in opting for hybrid or electric cars.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 10%;"><i class="bi bi-diamond"></i> 4 participants shared that what they believe could help
        fight against climate change is making larger entities such as the government and corporations responsible for
        the change. These ranged from passing more regulations on corporations that produce the majority of the waste to
        donating money to credible organizations that deal with the environment. 2 responses in this grouping added that
        larger entities would bring more positive impact than an individual ever could and that it is unfair to place
        the sole responsibility of reversal and conservation on the consumer. Creating more awareness through education
        was also an interesting response as well as encouraging others to make small changes but expected, as 18.2% of
        participants were not or barely familiar with climate change.</p>
      </p>
      <p><i class="bi bi-diamond-fill" style="font-size: 1rem;"></i> With these findings, we aim to design a product
        that supports the willingness demonstrated by the participants to change or limit the decisions made that impact
        the environment. However, it is understandable that many users are not seeking an entire lifestyle change but
        are rather asking for ways to be educated about the issue. And because some participants felt that expecting
        individuals to take on the role of environmental conservationists burdensome, a type of social platform that
        allows users to log their activities and the carbon footprint created from them and support each other in making
        eco-friendlier choices is what we planned to design.</p>

            and
            their respective carbon emissions
            emitted. Based on the trends of the activities stored, the user would start seeing suggestions for lifestyle
            changes to offset the emissions. These suggestions would also include resources such as news articles that
            redirect the user from the website to those pages. However, this design does not foster a community-based
            environment and focused excessively on the calculator and logging feature. The tailoring of suggested
            content
            also raised concerns about the amount of user data being given to outside entities.</p>
          <p><i class="bi bi-caret-left-fill"></i>The second design built upon the carbon calculator and activity log
            feature and also added a news feed and threads to meet the goal of creating a social platform. The team

      <p><i class="bi bi-diamond-fill" style="font-size: 1rem; margin-left: 6%;"></i>After selecting a digital
        prototype, we conducted heuristic evaluation. The main severe issues with the chosen user interface are:</p>
      <p><i class="bi bi-diamond" style="font-size: 1rem; margin-left: 8%;"></i>The UI is too overwhelming for the user
        so separating features into their own page would be helpful. The app also lacks a name.</p>
      <p><i class="bi bi-diamond" style="font-size: 1rem; margin-left: 8%;"></i>It’s not user-intuitive due to the lack
        of labeling.</p>
      <p><i class="bi bi-diamond" style="font-size: 1rem; margin-left: 8%;"></i>The user should be aware that the
        information logged is being stored, so there should be a pop-up window asking for approval.</p>
      <p><i class="bi bi-diamond" style="font-size: 1rem; margin-left: 8%;"></i>While there’s a news feed, it doesn’t
        have much room for users to interact with one another.</p>

      <p><i class="bi bi-diamond" style="font-size: 1rem; margin-left: 8%;"></i>Since the website is collecting user
        data (self-provided through the activities log), Xinrong stated there’s an issue with not having a history/log

      <p><i class="bi bi-diamond" style="font-size: 1rem; margin-left: 8%;"></i>Xinrong also raised that there is a lack

      <p style="margin-left:5.5%;"><b>Usability Testing: </b></p>
      <p style=" margin-left: 6%;"><i class="bi bi-diamond-fill"></i>Because we presented a design
        prototype rather than a functioning website, we aimed to learn how users navigate through the app and see if
        they intuitively knew how to create, update, and delete the content as if it were a functioning product. We also
        sought criticism for the features and layouts on the prototype so that we can improve the design and present a
        product with a more satisfying user experience. Based on our participants, “Calculator” confused them as they
        did not think it was a carbon footprint calculator. Some colors were too bright and some were too light and felt
        faded. The lack of guidance on some features has made some participants feel lost. Some felt the aesthetic of
        the design was moderately dull, however, the simple design made the product feel “easy” rather than difficult.

        usability
        tests over Discord by having participants share their screen and make comments through the microphone. The
        observations were the following:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 12%;">(Xinrong) Navigation through the app was somewhat easy for the users. What people
        have the most trouble with was the sidebar. The icon for the sidebar was somewhat
        hidden and not noticeable for users to go into. “Calculator” does not fit in with the app and our user thought
        the “Calculator” is like for simple math.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 12%;">(Jade) Participants struggled to find out how to delete posts. It seemed intuitive
        for some
        of the participants to figure out where to add content, however. Some participants did not realize this is a
        product centered around offsetting a user’s calculated carbon footprint through community and individual
        efforts. A participant found colors that strayed from the main color scheme to be abrupt.

      <p style=" margin-left: 6%;"><i class="bi bi-diamond-fill"></i>With these observations and the feedback we
        gathered through our participants in the usability test, changes to the design were necessary. The “Calculator”
        needs a new name to fit the app and should be put in the navigation bar rather than the navigation drawer. A
        helpful guide on the screen that leads users to use the sidebar could be a plus. The next iteration followed the
        green color scheme consistently rather than having different colors/inferred personalization. Different
        background colors can help out in highlighting the post/event, however. Placeholder text has been removed and
        replaced with the simulated content. Because the design only displayed “content” made by the “user” on the
        profile page, participants didn’t initially know where to delete posts. The next iteration displayed “user’s”
        content on the home page to remedy this.
        The iteration can be viewed here: <a
          href="https://www.figma.com/file/gL4RKq5xRNzOwAUvrVvmBQ/Final-Iteration?node-id=0%3A1">

      <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-green"><b>Future Design:</b></h1>
      <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid lightgreen" class="w3-round">
      <p><i class="bi bi-diamond-fill" style="font-size: 1rem;"></i>The design has the potential to depict further
        social features such as direct messaging. This would improve the user experience because it would supplement
        existing features like event creation and commenting under posts. It would also strengthen the goal for users to
        collaborate with others in making changes to their lifestyles. Because there was concern regarding data
        collection from the activities logged, the activity log design is limited in remaining as a diary without
        allowing third parties to show tailored or suggested advertisements.</p>
        <p>From the experience gained over the
          course of this process, there are a few things that future designers should and shouldn’t do. Designers should
          make as many prototypes as possible from all members. That way, there is definitely a lot more variety of
          features and aesthetics in the future iterations rather than a commitment to the very first or second design.
          The second thing designers should do is create different flows in Figma. This would help improve an iteration by
          exploring the design as if they were a user and seeing what works and what doesn’t.</p>
